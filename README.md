# CoinCollector
Uses Binance Official API to connect account and make operations on XRP/BTC or IOTA/BTC.
Please edit config.py with your API keys and edit coin type in the beginning of CoinCollector.py.
This is just for sample usage of some of Binance official API functions.
It is not for trading purposes. I am not your financial adviser, nor is this tool. 
Risks of running code is your own decision.
Use this program as an educational tool, and nothing more.
